LED Maze Game uses an Arduino-controlled 8x8 LED matrix and a web interface that allows players to navigate a maze using arrow keys. It includes a Python FastAPI backend for communication and provides setup instructions for hardware, Arduino code, and frontend controls. Everytime the maze is complete, a new maze is generated using Prim's algorithm.
